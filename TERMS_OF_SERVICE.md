4. Data and Third-Party Services
The Bot retrieves data from third-party sources (including UEX’s APIs). While every effort is made to ensure data accuracy, the Bot owner does not warrant the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of such data. You acknowledge that any reliance on third-party data is at your own risk, and the Bot owner is not liable for inaccuracies or interruptions resulting from those services.

6. Termination
The Bot owner reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Bot, with or without notice, if you violate these Terms or if deemed necessary for operational or security reasons. Upon termination, any rights granted to you under these Terms will immediately cease.

7. Changes to the Terms
The Bot owner may update these Terms at any time. Notice of changes may be provided via the Bot or associated channels. Your continued use of the Bot following any modifications signifies your acceptance of the updated Terms. It is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically.
